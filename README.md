##Internship


This Repository includes project done at Flip Robo as part of Data Sciene & Machine Learning Internship

Internship Duration - 6 Months (April 2022 - October 2022)

- For some Projects data set was given while for other projects webscraping was done using Selenium or beautifulSoup before model building.
- For each project detailed project report and presentation has been prepared along with ML Model juypter Notebook which you can find in respective project folder.
-
